    "This notebook is intended to learn linear programming by solving several problems using Python solver. Herein, the [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/) library is chosen as a solver packages. \n",

    "Linear programming often involves maximising or minimising an objective function which subject to several constraints. To solve optimization problems, the following steps are generally carried out:\n",
    "1. Clearly make the problem description\n",

    "3. Solve the mathematical program\n",
    "4. Perform post-optimal analysis\n",
    "5. Present the solution and analysis\n",

    "**Agregate Planning Red Tomato Tools** - The problem is taken from *Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operation - Chapter 8* \n",
    "\n",
    "The demand for Red Tomato’s gardening tools from consumers is highly seasonal, peaking in the\n",
    "spring as people plant their gardens. This seasonal demand ripples up the supply chain from the\n",
    "retailer to Red Tomato, the manufacturer. The options Red Tomato has for handling the seasonality are adding workers during the peak season, subcontracting out some of the work, building up inventory during the slow months, or building up a backlog of orders that will be delivered late to customers. To determine how to best use these options through an aggregate plan, Red Tom to’s vice president of supply chain starts with the first task—building a demand forecast. Although Red Tomato could attempt to forecast this demand itself, a much more accurate forecast comes from a collaborative process used by both Red Tomato and its retailers to produce the forecast shown in Table 8-2. It is important that this demand account for the product mix that is expected to sell and be in terms of aggregate units defined earliear.\n",

    "Red Tomato sells each tool through retailers for $\\$$40. The company has a starting inventory in January of 1,000 tools. At the beginning of January, the company has a workforce of 80 employees. The plant has a total of 20 working days in each month, and each employee earns $\\$$4 per hour regular time. Each employee works eight hours per day on straight time and the rest on overtime. As discussed previously, the capacity of the production operation is determined primarily by the total labor hours worked. Therefore, machine capacity does not limit the capacity of the production operation. Because of labor rules, no employee works more than 10 hours of overtime per month. The various costs are shown in Table 8-3. It is important that the costs and labor hours are in aggregate units, as discussed in Section 8.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Red Tomato has no limits on subcontracting, inventories, and tockouts/backlog. All stockouts are backlogged and supplied from the following months’ production. Inventory costs are incurred on the ending inventory in the month. The supply cha n manager’s goal is to obtain the optimal aggregate plan that allows Red Tomato to end June  ith at least 500 units (i.e., no stockouts at the end of June and at least 500 units in inventory).\n"
