    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to learn linear programming by solving several problems using Python solver. Herein, the [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/) library is chosen as a solver packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear programming often involves maximising or minimising an objective function which subject to several constraints. To solve optimization problems, the following steps are generally carried out:\n",
    "1. Clearly make the problem description\n",
    "2. Formulate the problem into mathematical formulation\n",
    "3. Solve the mathematical program\n",
    "4. Perform post-optimal analysis\n",
    "5. Present the solution and analysis\n",

    "The problem used in this notebook will be varied ranging from text book, online source, and real problems. \n",
